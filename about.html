      <h3>This site is a portfolio of my most valuable work done so far.</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>I first got interested in AI after finding videos on youtube. Because it is seen as a magical thinking algorithm, I was intrigued to learn more. After researching more videos on youtube, I was able to find a book about how to make a Neural Network from scratch, which can be found <a href="https://nnfs.io/" target="_blank">here.</a> Long story short, a Neural Network is an algorithm modeled after the human brain, which can take an input and produce an output.</li>
        <br>
        <li>After learning about AI, I became interested in car self driving. I researched brands like tesla and google, mainly being inspired by the road visualization system.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Most recently, I have been developing a game with my brother. The game is inpsired by a peacful adventure game named <a href="https://thatgamecompany.com/journey/" target="_blank">Journey.</a></li>
